Include a README file and select the project's main language in the dropdown list for .gitignore templates</p> What is a .gitignore file? <p>The .gitignore file is used by Github to identify any files on your local repository that shouldn't be saved on its cloud service. By selecting your main project language Github produces an intelligent template of file types that would be unnecessary or dangerous to store. To learn more click here.</p> Why include a README? <p>For any project it is recommended to include a README.md file. README files serve as a space where you can make a more detailed summary of the technology, functionality and structure of a project. At the very least this is very useful when returning to old work after a while. To learn more click here.</p> <p>6. If your repository is public, choose a license for your work that defines the regulations around your code being used by others.</p> The MIT license is your best friend <p>The MIT license is simple, easy to understand and quite fair, making it my personal recommendation for learning projects.
