The <code>origin master</code> clause now tells Git what remote repository and what branch to retrieve the data from.</p> What does the --allow-unrelated-histories flag do? <p>Flags in Git are an additional modifier included when the action being taken needs to be modified due to a unique circumstance. In this case <code>--allow-unrelated-histories</code> informs the Git scripting language that we are merging two repositories which have separate files and commit in them. This flag needs to be used because behind the scenes Github created a commit on the local repository in order to create our .gitignore file</p> Success <p>The terminal should return an address from which the data was pulled alongside the branch. After this it return a message listing out the number of files changed and the number of lines inserted and deleted.

Run the following command to upload all of your added and committed changes onto Github's remote repository.</p> <pre><code>git push\n</code></pre> What is git push? <p><code>git push</code> is used to update a remote repository with the changes that have been made on the local file system. It can be thought of as the command for saving a backup of your committed work on the internet.</p> Success <p>The terminal should return several lines outlining the procedure it took to perform the action.
