# Task 1 - Creating a Local Repository

The purpose of this section of the documentation is to help users set up their git hub locally using the command line. This section goes on to show you the step by step process
of the commands needed to set up your repository. The git repository can  be used to saved code that you have worked on, as well as collaborate with other using shared code.

## Task 1.1 - Initialize a Git Repository

1\. To begin with make sure you have VSCode's integrated terminal open on the directory system you are storing in your local repository.

2\. The first step in creating a local repository is to initialize it using the Git scripting language. To do this, input the following command into the command line interface.

```git
git init
```

??? info "What is git init?"
    `git init` informs the Git scripting language to create a .git directory at your current location in the terminal. The .git directory is where your local repository is stored.

3\. Run the following command to create a README file:

```git
git add README.md
```

??? info "Why include a README?"
    For any project it is recommended to include a README.md file. README files serve as a space where you can make a more detailed summary of the technology, functionality and structure of a project. At the very least this is very useful when returning to old work after a while. To learn more [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/).

## Task 1.2 - Add Your Changes to The Local Respository

1\. Run the following command in the command line interface to ensure that the Git scripting language can see all the files in the directory.

```git
git status
```

??? info "What does git status do?"
    `git status` displays a list of paths inside the project which are different from the information that is stored in the local repository. When you first start a repository every file in the project should appear marked in red after the command is run.

??? success
    A list of filepaths prefixed with `modified:` and marked in red. The list should include every file in the project.

2\. Add any changes or progress made in git repository.

```git
git add .
```

??? info "What does git add . do?"
    `git add` informs the Git scripting language of what files you want it to update on its copy of your project. The `.` that follows it a shorthand that tells the Git scripting language that we want it to update changes on all the files that have been modified. If you wanted to add a specific set of files, you would run the `git add <file_name>` command for each one.

3\. Run the command from step 1 once more to ensure that the Git scripting language is now tracking changes in all the files in the directory.

```git
git status
```

??? success
    A list of filepaths prefixed with `modified:` and marked in green. The list should include every file in the project.

4\. Finalize those changes by adding the following command into you command line interface. This so that the Git scripting language knows that these changes are authorized to save in the repository

```git
git commit -m "<description_of_the_changes_made>"
```

??? info "What is git commit?"
    `git commit` informs the Git scripting language to transfer any changes added with the `git add` command onto its copy of your project. After this command is run with the ` git add .` command there are no changes between the project in your OS memory and the version being stored by Git.

??? info "What does the -m flag do?"
    Flags in Git are an additional modifier included when the action being taken needs to be modified due to a unique circumstance. In this case `-m` informs the Git scripting language that we are both creating a new commit and creating a message to describe it at the same time.

??? tip "Always make sure your commits have a meaningful message"
    Work that has been committed is viewed by colleagues and potentially even yourself down the line. Having a meaningful description of each incremental change makes it clear from the outside in as to what your thought process and approach was.

5\. Run the `git status` command from step 1 and 3 to confirm that the changes have been moved over to your local repository.

```git
git status
```

??? success
    The returned message should end with `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. This means that your local repository and the project on your OS are now in sync.
